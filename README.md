# CodeWars
---

[CodeWars](http://www.codewars.com/) is a website where you can improve your skills by training with others on real code challenges.

Each challenge is ranked from `8 Kyu` (easy, basic, fundamentals) to `1 Kyu` (hard, expert, compilers).

This repository shows all the work I've done there.

Language: Python 3.10
